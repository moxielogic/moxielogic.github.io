    <p>The hacker behind the <a href="http://www.minecraft.net/">Minecraft</a> phenomena, Notch, is working on his
<a href="http://0x10c.com/">next game</a>, most likely another hit. This one is interesting in that
it includes an in-game 16-bit processor called the dcpu-16. Details are
sparse, but it seems as though gamers will use this processor to control
spacecraft and play ...</p>

They require some tricky work to set up properly on Fedora - my dev host

  <div class="article_text">
    <p>Tip #1 was about using an external process to perform dynamic
translations of signal display values. GTKWave can also perform simple
static translations of data. In the example below, for instance, moxie's
execute unit is receiving a 4-bit signal identifying "register A"
(riA_i) for whatever operation is about to ...</p>

    <p>I've coded up logic for more arithmetic instructions, register moves, as
well as direct and indirect jumps. For jumps, I simply pass a branch
signal from the execute stage back to the fetch stage, as well as the
computed target address. Here's some code that works now:</p>
